# Array

A couple of functions are added to the `Array` prototype and constructor to make working with `Result` easier.

You can check [their implementations here](https://github.com/hobnail-dev/overture/blob/main/packages/result/src/array.ts).

> `.function` functions starting with `.` are instance functions. 
>
> `::function` functions starting with `::` are static functions.
